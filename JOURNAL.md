## 10/11/2025 - planned out the design  

so i planned out what exactly do i want out of this keeb, im kinda confused bw a 5col or 6 col, 6 col comes with its own wins, not having to switch to different layers, hmmm. i should go with 6 col layout. lemme drop the design reference.![img.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--faa7c4a2d2cd0147f3d75a943f252332c5f09240/img.jpg)
