## 10/11/2025 12 AM - planned out the design  

so i planned out what exactly do i want out of this keeb, im kinda confused bw a 5col or 6 col, 6 col comes with its own wins, not having to switch to different layers, hmmm. i should go with 6 col layout. lemme drop the design reference.![img.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--faa7c4a2d2cd0147f3d75a943f252332c5f09240/img.jpg)

or a 5 col??? im really confused tbh.

so this is just a reference, next update will be regarding the pcb.


  

## 10/11/2025 11 PM - 5 col it is then  

yea, five col it is then, reason? more portable and easy config apparently. today i spent around an hour looking for a pcb, and parts, dumbing down it into five major thingis ill need.

pcb - this is the board where everything connects. need one for each half of the split.
switches - these are the clicky bits under the keys. i'll pick some nice linear ones maybe.
keycaps - the tops of the keys. want something comfy and low profile.
case - to hold it all together. could be acrylic or something simple.
controller - like a pro micro to make it smart and connect the halves with a cable.

hmm, also to make it look more clean, i should go for wireless one, so maybe you can drop a small battery in both of these two. thats it for today![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY0OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--57797ece2456857b91f40a67faba46e1a06aba3d/image.png)
  

## 10/14/2025 - another pivot  

after being confused, for quite awhile, a 34 keyboard layout seems perfet for me? you may ask why? its portable, my desk is pretty small and i dont want it cluttered up.

i spent around 2 hours, desigining its pcb, and the final is yet to come, logging progress until here.

## 10/16/2025 - routed the pcb, did the schematics  

got the official price frome the jlcpcb website, man they eating a lot on shipping, (chose the slowest shipping option), still its at 40ish something, i can get the 3d parts printed at my sschool, so no issue with that, gotta decide the switches and keycaps, brainstrommed alot on lcak about what kinda battery i should chose.

todo:
- figure out switchs and keycaps
- create a 3d model so you can book the slot for printing.
